					<h2>Bao's Diary</h2><br />
					<p>
					Yesterday a woman walked into the pet shop and saw me shrunk in the corner. She picked me up slowly and took me to a strange place. She said that this will be my home in the future.
					<br /><br />
					As soon as I opened my eyes today, I saw her smiling at me and lifting me up. This is the first time I have been lifted up, and I have seen a whole new world.
